# üè• Patient Management System with Microservices

This repository is a **learning project** where I explored **microservices architecture** using **Java Spring Boot** to enhance my programming skills and deepen my understanding of backend development. The main goal of this project was to build a **production-ready Patient Management System** capable of managing patients, appointments, and notifications in a scalable and modular way.  

Throughout this project, I practiced creating **RESTful APIs**, **containerizing applications with Docker**, and deploying services on **AWS**, which provided hands-on experience with real-world software development and cloud deployment. Working on this system helped me strengthen my **Java programming skills**, understand **microservice design patterns**, and learn how to build applications that are maintainable, loosely coupled, and ready for scaling.  

The project is divided into multiple microservices, each serving a specific purpose: `patient-service` manages patient records, `appointment-service` handles scheduling and managing appointments, and `notification-service` is responsible for sending notifications. Each service runs independently, has its own database, and communicates via REST APIs to ensure a modular and flexible architecture.  

### Features

The Patient Management System comes with several key features that demonstrate real-world functionality. It allows users to **add, update, and retrieve patient information**, which ensures that all medical records are organized and easily accessible. The system also supports **appointment scheduling**, allowing patients and staff to manage upcoming appointments efficiently. Additionally, it includes a **notification service**, which can send alerts or reminders to patients, ensuring better communication and patient engagement. All of these features are designed to work together seamlessly within a microservices framework, highlighting best practices in modular and scalable software design.  

Another important aspect of the project is that each service can be deployed independently, which demonstrates **scalability and flexibility**. Docker is used to containerize the services, allowing them to run consistently across different environments, and AWS provides a cloud deployment solution that mimics real-world production conditions. This combination of features and architecture gives a complete learning experience for anyone exploring modern backend development and microservices.  

By building this project, I gained a **practical understanding of microservices**, strengthened my **Java and Spring Boot skills**, and learned how to integrate cloud deployment, containerization, and API design into a single cohesive system.
